## Show a random meme by selecting a folder 
- Auto mode: Show a meme every X time -Random: Show a randomly selected meme 
- Immersion mode: It´s just fullscreen lol You may modify the maxium value for memes per second, but be careful becuase it requieres a lot of RAM and disk usage!

For 16 memes per second (m/2) it requires about 350 MB of RAM
